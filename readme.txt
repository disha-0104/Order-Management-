Introduction
TITLE: USER CASE- ORDER MANAGEMENT system PROBLEM STATEMENT: AI-driven platform that processes attached recordings to understand the context of customer queries regarding their orders. The system will extract relevant information, analyse customer concerns, and generate accurate responses, mimicking a call center agentâ€™s capabilities. It will integrate with existing order management systems to ensure real-time, seamless query resolution. This solution aims to enhance customer satisfaction, reduce response times, and improve operational efficiency.

SOLUTION OVERVIEW:
Complex User Interactions: - The bot needs to handle a wide variety of user inputs and scenarios, such as new orders, modifications, deletions, and viewing summaries. - Ensuring smooth conversation flow while capturing and validating user data like phone numbers, addresses, and emails.

Database Integration: - Managing the integration with an SQLite database for storing and retrieving customer and order information. - Ensuring database transactions are performed efficiently and securely.

Dialog Management: - Handling multiple dialogs and steps to guide users through various processes. - Managing the state across different conversation flows to ensure data consistency.

Error Handling and Logging: - Properly handling errors and exceptions to avoid crashes and ensure a smooth user experience. - Logging activities and errors for monitoring and debugging purposes.
